This project is about creating a testbed for understanding user behaviors.

• Creates behavioral testbeds with three persona categories: regular users, threat actors, and security practitioners
• Introduces three evaluation metrics: Persona Fidelity Index, Behavioral Diversity Index, and Vulnerability Detection Rate
• Aims to proactively discover security vulnerabilities and privacy risks through automated persona-based testing
