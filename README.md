• Creates  a behavioral testbed with three persona categories: regular users, threat actors, and security practitioners
• Introduces three evaluation metrics: Persona Fidelity Index, Behavioral Diversity Index, and Vulnerability Detection Rate
• Aims to proactively discover security vulnerabilities and privacy risks through automated persona-based testing


A fundamental challenge in system design and security research is the inability to test across the full spectrum of user diversity. While planning phases identify the need to consider various user groups—including those with different technical expertise, cultural backgrounds, accessibility requirements, or usage contexts—researchers often cannot directly access or engage these diverse populations during testing. This gap between recognized user diversity needs and actual testing capabilities creates blind spots in security and usability assessments.

The testbed addresses this critical limitation by simulating diverse user behaviors, enabling researchers to proactively identify vulnerabilities and privacy risks across user groups that would otherwise remain untested. Additionally, the research aims to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of persona-based modeling in representing real user behaviors during security assessments.
